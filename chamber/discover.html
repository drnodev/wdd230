                El Tunco (a very Salvadoran word for pigs), is the most emblematic surfing destination in El Salvador.
                <br>
                Located just 7 kilometers west of the port of La Libertad, El Tunco is a microcosm where you can breathe
                a cosmopolitan atmosphere, abundant fun and "chiva" wave, as they say locally to express something
                great.

                Cerro Eramón (also known as Cerro Iramón), is located at an altitude of 937 meters above sea level in
                the municipality of San Antonio de La Cruz, in Chalatenango.
                <br>
                Due to its elevation, from it you can see wonderful landscapes, such as: The reservoir of the 5 de
                Noviembre Dam, the Cerrón Grande Dam, the Lempa River, the Sumpul and the volcanoes Chinchontepec, San
                Salvador and those to the west such as: the Izalco, Cerro Verde and Lamatepec or Santa Ana.

                The fireballs is a tradition that takes place every year in Nejapa, department of San Salvador, every
                August 31st.
                <br>
                This is a very special celebration for the inhabitants of Nejapa and also for many people from other
                departments and foreigners who visit it, because all the streets of Nejapa are filled with this very
                peculiar atmosphere, although at the same time it is very dangerous.

                The Mirador El Espíritu de la Montaña is one of those unique viewpoints in El Salvador. Unlike other
                viewpoints in the country, where you can see the city, a mountainous area or a lake, this viewpoint
                offers a spectacular view of the Gulf of Fonseca and its islands.
                <br>
                It is located in the Conchagua Volcano, department of La Union, the easternmost department of El
                Salvador, which has a land border with Honduras. In other words, the Mirador El Espiritu de la Montaña
                is in one of the corners of El Salvador.
